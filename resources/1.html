<h2>Stand by me</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
When the night has come  <br>
And the land is dark <br>
And the moon is the only light we'll see <br>
No I won't be afraid <br>
Oh, I won't be afraid <br>
Just as long as you stand, stand by me <br>
So darling, darling <br>
Stand by me, oh stand by me <br>
Oh stand, stand by me <br>
Stand by me <br>
If the sky that we look upon <br>
Should tumble and fall <br>
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea <br>
I won't cry, I won't cry <br>
No, I won't shed a tear <br>
Just as long as you stand, stand by me <br>
And darling, darling <br>
Stand by me, oh stand by me <br>
Oh stand now, stand by me <br>
Stand by me <br>
Darling, darling <br>
Stand by me, oh stand by me <br>
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me <br>
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me <br>
Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand <br>
Stand by me... <br>
</font></p>
