<h2>Country Roads</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>

Almost Heaven, West Virginia <br>
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River <br>
Life is old there, older than the trees <br>
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze <br>
     <br>
Country roads, take me home <br>
To the place I belong <br>
West Virginia, mountain mama <br>
Take me home, country roads <br>
     <br>
All my memories gather 'round her <br>
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water <br>
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky <br>
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye <br>
     <br>
Country roads, take me home <br>
To the place I belong <br>
West Virginia, mountain mama <br>
Take me home, country roads <br>
     <br>
I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me <br>
The radio reminds me of my home far away <br>
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin' <br>
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday <br>
     <br>
Country roads, take me home <br>
To the place I belong <br>
West Virginia, mountain mama <br>
Take me home, country roads <br>
     <br>
Take me home, country roads <br>
Take me home, (down) country roads <br>
Take me home, (down) country roads <br>
