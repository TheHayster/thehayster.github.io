<h2>Sweet Caroline</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Where it began <br>
I can't begin to know when <br>
But then I know it's growin' strong <br>
Was in the spring <br>
And spring became the summer <br>
Who'd have believe you'd come along? <br>
Hands <br>
Touchin' hands <br>
Reachin' out <br>
Touching me, touchin' you <br>
Sweet Caroline (Ba Ba Baaa) <br>
Good times never seemed so good (so good, so good!) <br>
I've been inclined (Ba Ba Baaa) <br>
To believe they never would <br>
But now I look at the night <br>
And it don't seem so lonely <br>
We fill it up with only two <br>
And when I hurt <br>
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders <br>
How can I hurt when holdin' you? <br>
Warm <br>
Touchin' warm <br>
Reachin' out <br>
Touchin' me, touchin' you <br>
Sweet Caroline (Ba Ba Baaa) <br>
Good times never seemed so good (so good, so good!) <br>
I've been inclined (Ba Ba Baaa) <br>
To believe they never would, oh, no, no <br>
Sweet Caroline (Ba Ba Baaa) <br>
Good times never seemed so good (so good, so good!) <br>
Sweet Caroline (Ba Ba Baaa) <br>
I believe they never could <br>
Sweet Caroline <br>
