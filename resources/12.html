<h2>Bad Moon Rising</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>

I see the bad moon a-risin' <br>
I see trouble on the way <br>
I see earthquakes and lightnin' <br>
I see bad times today <br>
     <br>
Don't go around tonight <br>
Well it's bound to take your life <br>
There's a bad moon on the rise <br>
     <br>
I hear hurricanes a-blowin' <br>
I know the end is comin' soon <br>
I fear rivers over flowin' <br>
I hear the voice of rage and ruin <br>
     <br>
Don't go around tonight <br>
Well it's bound to take your life <br>
There's a bad moon on the rise, alright <br>
     <br>
Hope you got your things together <br>
Hope you are quite prepared to die <br>
Looks like we're in for nasty weather <br>
One eye is taken for an eye <br>
     <br>
Well don't go around tonight <br>
Well it's bound to take your life <br>
There's a bad moon on the rise <br>
     <br>
Don't come around tonight <br>
Well it's bound to take your life <br>
There's a bad moon on the rise <br>
