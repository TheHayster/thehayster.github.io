<h2>Wasn't that a party</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Could have been the whiskey, might have been the gin. <br>
Could have been three or four six-packs, <br>
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in, <br>
My head is like a football, I think I'm gonna die, <br>
Tell me, me oh me oh my, <br>
Wasn't that a party! <br>
  <br>
Someone took a grapefruit and wore it like a hat, <br>
I saw someone under my kitchen table, talking to my old tom cat, <br>
They were talking about hockey and the cat was talkin' back, <br>
Along about then everything went black, <br>
But wasn't that a party! <br>
  <br>
I'm sure it's just my memory playin' tricks on me, <br>
But I think I saw my buddy cuttin' down my neighbour's tree, <br>
  <br>
Could have been the whiskey, might have been the gin. <br>
Could have been three or four six-packs, <br>
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in, <br>
My head is like a football, I think I'm gonna die, <br>
Tell me, me oh me oh my, <br>
Wasn't that a party! <br>
  <br>
Old Billy Joe and Tommy, well they went a little far, <br>
They were sitting in my backyard blowing on the siren in somebody's police car. <br>
So you see, your honour, <br>
It was all in fun, <br>
That little bitty track meet down on main street, <br>
Was just to see if the cops could run, <br>
Well, they run us in to see you, <br>
In an alcoholic haze, <br>
I can sure use those thirty days to recover from the party. <br>
