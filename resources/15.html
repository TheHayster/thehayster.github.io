<h2>Hallelujah</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Now I've heard there was a secret chord <br>
That David played, and it pleased the Lord <br>
But you don't really care for music, do you? <br>
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth <br>
The minor falls, the major lifts <br>
The baffled king composing Hallelujah <br>
  <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
  <br>
Your faith was strong but you needed proof <br>
You saw her bathing on the roof <br>
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you <br>
She tied you to a kitchen chair <br>
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair <br>
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah <br>
  <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
  <br>
Maybe I've been here before <br>
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor <br>
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya <br>
And I've seen your flag on the marble lodge <br>
Love is not a victory march <br>
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah <br>
 <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
  <br>
there was a time you let me know <br>
What's really going on below <br>
But now you never show that to me, do ya? <br>
But remember when I moved in you <br>
And the holy dove was moving too <br>
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah <br>
 <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelu...jah <br>
