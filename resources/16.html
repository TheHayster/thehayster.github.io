<h2>Me and Bobby McGee</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headed' for a train <br>
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans <br>
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained <br>
Took us all the way into New Orleans <br>
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana <br>
I's playin' sad while Bobby sang the blues <br>
With those windshield wipers slappin' time, and Bobby's clappin hands <br>
We finally sang every song that driver knew <br>
  <br>
Freedom's is just another word for nothin' left to lose <br>
Nothin', ain't worth nothin' but it's free <br>
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues <br>
Feelin' good was good enough for me <br>
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee <br>
  <br>
From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun <br>
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul <br>
Standin right beside me Lord, through everything I've done <br>
Every night she kept me from the cold <br>
Then one day up near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away <br>
Lookin' for that home, and I hope she found <br>
And I'd give all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday <br>
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine <br>
  <br>
Freedom's is just another word for nothin' left to lose <br>
Nothin', ain't worth nothin' but it's free <br>
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues <br>
Feelin' good was good enough for me <br>
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee  <br>
  <br>
La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da <br>
La-da-da-da me and Bobby McGee <br>
  <br>
La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da <br>
La-da-da-da me and Bobby McGee <br>
  <br>
La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da <br>
La-da-da-da me and Bobby McGee <br>
  <br>
La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da <br>
La-da-da-da me and Bobby McGee <br>
