<h2>Sundown</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
I can see her lying back in her satin dress <br>
In a room where you do what you don't confess <br>
  <br>
Sundown, you better take care <br>
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs <br>
Sundown, you better take care <br>
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs <br>
  <br>
She's been looking like a queen in a sailor's dream <br>
And she don't always say what she really means <br>
  <br>
Sometimes I think it's a shame <br>
When I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain <br>
Sometimes I think it's a shame <br>
When I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain <br>
  <br>
[Brief instrumental] <br>
  <br>
I can picture every move that a man could make <br>
Getting lost in her loving is your first mistake <br>
  <br>
Sundown, you better take care <br>
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs <br>
Sometimes I think it's a sin <br>
When I feel like I'm winning, when I'm losing again <br>
  <br>
 [Brief instrumental] <br> 
 <br>
I can see her looking fast in her faded jeans <br>
She's a hard lovn' woman, got me feeling mean <br>
  <br>
Sometimes I think it's a shame <br>
When I get feeling better, when I'm feeling no pain <br>
Sundown, you better take care <br>
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs <br>
Sundown, you better take care <br>
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs <br>
Sometimes I think it's a sin <br>
When I feel like I'm winning, when I'm losing again <br>
