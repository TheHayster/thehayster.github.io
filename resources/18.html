<h2>Sittin on the dock of the bay</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Sittin' in the mornin' sun <br>
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come <br>
Watching the ships roll in <br>
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah <br>
  <br>
I'm just sttin on the dock of the bay<br>
Watching the tide roll away <br>
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay <br>
Wastin' time <br>
  <br>
I left my home in Georgia <br>
Headed for the 'Frisco bay <br>
I've had nothing to live for <br>
Look like nothin's gonna come my way <br>
  <br>
So I'm just sttin on the dock of the bay <br>
Watching the tide roll away <br>
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay <br>
Wastin' time <br>
  <br>
Look like nothing's gonna change <br>
Everything still remains the same <br>
I can't do what ten people tell me to do <br>
So I guess I'll remain the same, yeah <br>
  <br>
Sittin' here resting my bones <br>
And this loneliness won't leave me alone <br>
It's two thousand miles I roamed <br>
Just to make this dock my home <br>
  <br>
So, I'm just sttin on the dock of the bay <br>
Watching the tide roll away <br>
Sittin' on the dock of the bay <br>
Wastin' time <br>
