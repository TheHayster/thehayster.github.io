<h2>What's up</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
All these years and my life is still <br>
Trying to get up that great big hill <br>
Of hope for a destination<br><br>
  
I realized quickly when I knew I should<br>
That the world was made up of this brotherhood<br>
Of man, <br>
for whatever that  means<br><br>

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed<br>
Just to  get it all out, what's in my head<br>
And I  I'm feeling a little peculiar<br><br>

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside<br>
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and<br>
I scream from the top of my lungs "What's going on?"<br><br>
 
And I said "Hey yea yea yea yeah; Hey yea yeah"<br>
I said "Hey, what's going on?"<br>
And I said "Hey yea yea yea yeah; Hey yea yeah"<br>
I said "Hey, what's going on?"<br><br>

Ooh, Oooooh Ooooooh Ooooooh <br>
Ooh, Oooooh Ooooooh Ooooooh <br><br>

And I try, <br>
oh my God, do I try <br>
I try all the time, <br>
in this institution<br><br>

And I pray, <br>
oh my God, do I pray <br>
I pray every single day <br>
for a revolution<br><br>
 
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed<br>
Just to  get it all out, what's in my head<br>
And I  I'm feeling a little peculiar<br><br>

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside<br>
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and<br>
I scream from the top of my lungs "What's going on?"<br><br>

And I said "Hey yea yea yea yeah; Hey yea yeah"<br>
I said "Hey, what's going on?"<br>
And I said "Hey yea yea yea yeah; Hey yeah - Yeah yeah yeah yeah!"<br>
I said "Hey, what's going on?"<br><br>

All these years and my life is still <br>
Trying to get up that great big hill <br>
Of hope <br>
For a destination<br>
