<h2>Folsom Prison Blues</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
I hear the train a comin' <br>
It's rolling round the bend<br>
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when<br>
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on<br>
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone<br> 
<br>
When I was just a baby my mama told me<br>
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"<br>
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die<br>
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry<br>
<br>
  Interlude
  <br>
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car<br>
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars<br>
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free<br>
But those people keep a movin'<br>
And that's what tortures me<br>
<br>
  Interlude
  <br>
Well if they freed me from this prison<br>
If that railroad train was mine<br>
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line<br>
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay<br>
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away<br>
