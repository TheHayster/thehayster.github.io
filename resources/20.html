<h2>Viva Las Vegas</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Bright light city gonna set my soul Gonna set my soul on fire <br>
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn, So get those stakes up higher <br>
There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there, And they're all livin' devil may care  <br>
And I'm just the devil with a buck to spare <br>
     <br>
Viva las vegas, viva las vegas <br>
     <br>
How I wish that there were more Than the twenty-four hours in the day <br>
'cause even if there were forty more I wouldn't sleep a minute away <br>
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel <br>
A fortune won and lost on ev'ry deal <br>
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel <br>
     <br>
Viva las vegas, viva las vegas <br>
Viva las vegas with you neon flashin' <br>
And your one armbandits crashin' <br>
All those hopes down the drain <br>
Viva las vegas turnin' day into nighttime <br>
Turnin' night into daytime <br>
If you see it once <br>
You'll never be the same again <br>
     <br>
I'm gonna keep on the run I'm gonna have me some fun <br>
If it costs me my very last dime If I wind up broke up well <br>
I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time <br>
I'm gonna give it ev'rything I've got <br>
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot <br>
Let me shoot a seven with ev'ry shot <br>
Viva las vegas, viva las vegas, viva las vegas, <br>
Viva.... viva las vegas
