<h2>I can't help</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Wise men say   <br>
Only fools rush in   <br>
But I can't help falling in love with you   <br>
Shall I stay?   <br>
Would it be a sin   <br>
If I can't help falling in love with you?   <br>
Like a river flows   <br>
Surely to the sea   <br>
Darling, so it goes   <br>
Some things are meant to be   <br>
Take my hand   <br>
Take my whole life, too   <br>
For I can't help falling in love with you   <br>
Like a river flows   <br>
Surely to the sea   <br>
Darling, so it goes   <br>
Some things are meant to be   <br>
Take my hand   <br>
Take my whole life, too   <br>
For I can't help falling in love with you   <br>
For I can't help falling in love with you   <br>
</font></p>
