<h2>I'm yours</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Well, you done, done me in, you bet I felt it   <br>
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted   <br>
I fell right through the cracks   <br>
Now I'm trying to get back   <br>
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin' it my bestest   <br>
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention   <br>
I reckon it's again my turn   <br>
To win some or learn some   <br>
     <br>
But I won't hesitate no more, no more   <br>
It cannot wait, I'm yours   <br>  
     <br>
Do do do; do do  do doooo <br>   
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   <br>   <br>
Well, open up your mind and see like me   <br>
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free   <br>
Look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love   <br>
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing   <br>
We're just one big family   <br>
And it's our godforsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved   <br>   <br>
So I won't hesitate no more, no more   <br>
It cannot wait, I'm sure   <br>
There's no need to complicate, our time is short   <br>
This is our fate, I'm yours   <br>   <br>
 [interlude]  <br>
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror   <br>
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer   <br>
But my breath fogged up the glass   <br>
And so I drew a new face and I laughed   <br>
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason   <br>
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons   <br>
It's what we aim to do   <br>
Our name is our virtue   <br>   <br>
But I won't hesitate no more, no more   <br>
It cannot wait, I'm yours   <br>   <br>
Open up your mind and see like me   <br>
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free   <br>
Look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yours   <br>
So please don't, please don't, please don't   <br>
There's no need to complicate   <br>
'Cause our time is short   <br>
This, this is our fate   <br>
I'm yours   <br>
