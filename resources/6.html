<h2>The Gambler</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
	On a warm summer's evening  <br>
	On a train bound for nowhere <br>
	I met up with the gambler  <br>
	We were both too tired to sleep <br>
	So we took turns a-starin' <br>
	Out the window at the darkness <br>
	The boredom overtook us  <br>
	And he began to speak <br>
	He said, "Son, I've made a life  <br>
	Out of readin' people's faces  <br>
	Knowin' what the cards were <br>
	By the way they held their eyes <br>
	So if you don't mind my sayin' <br>
	I can see you're out of aces <br>
	For a taste of your whiskey <br>
	I'll give you some advice" <br>
	So I handed him my bottle <br>
	And he drank down my last swallow <br>
	Then he bummed a cigarette <br>
	And asked me for a light <br>
	And the night got deathly quiet <br>
	And his face lost all expression <br>
	Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy <br>
	You gotta learn to play it right <br>
	<br>
	You've got to know when to hold 'em <br>
	Know when to fold 'em <br>
	Know when to walk away <br>
	And know when to run <br>
	You never count your money <br>
	When you're sittin' at the table <br>
	There'll be time enough for countin' <br>
	When the dealin's done <br>
	<br>
	Every gambler knows <br>
	That the secret to survivin' <br>
	Is knowin' what to throw away <br>
	And knowin' what to keep <br>
	'Cause every hand's a winner <br>
	And every hand's a loser <br>
	And the best that you can hope for <br>
	Is to die in your sleep" <br>
	And when he'd finished speakin' <br>
	He turned back toward the window <br>
	Crushed out his cigarette <br>
	Faded off to sleep <br>
	And somewhere in the darkness <br>
	The gambler he broke even <br>
	But in his final words <br>
	I found an ace that I could keep <br>
	<br>
	You've got to know when to hold 'em <br>
	Know when to fold 'em <br>
	Know when to walk away <br>
	And know when to run <br>
	You never count your money <br>
	When you're sittin' at the table <br>
	There'll be time enough for countin' <br>
	When the dealin's done <br>
	<br>
	You've got to know when to hold 'em (when to hold 'em) <br>
	Know when to fold 'em (when to fold 'em) <br>
	Know when to walk away <br>
	And know when to run <br>
	You never count your money <br>
	When you're sittin' at the table <br>
	There'll be time enough for countin' <br>
	When the dealin's done <br>
	<br>
	You've got to know when to hold 'em <br>
	Know when to fold 'em <br>
	Know when to walk away <br>
	And know when to run <br>
	You never count your money <br>
	When you're sittin' at the table <br>
	There'll be time enough for countin' <br>
	When the dealin's done <br>
