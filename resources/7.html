<h2>Brown eyed girl</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Hey, where did we go? <br>
Days when the rains came <br>
Down in the hollow <br>
Playin' a new game <br>
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey <br>
Skippin' and a-jumpin' <br>
In the misty morning fog with <br>
Our, our hearts a-thumping and you <br>
  <br>
My brown-eyed girl <br>
you're my, my brown-eyed girl <br>
  <br>
And whatever happened <br>
To Tuesday and so slow? <br>
Going down the old mine with a <br>
Transistor radio <br>
Standing in the sunlight laughing <br>
Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall <br>
Slipping and sliding <br>
All along the waterfall with you <br>
  <br>
My brown-eyed girl <br>
You're my brown-eyed girl <br>
Do you remember when we used to sing? <br>
  <br>
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da <br>
Just like that <br>
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da, la-tee-da <br>
  <br>
So hard to find my way <br>
Now that I'm all on my own <br>
I saw you just the other day <br>
My, how you have grown <br>
Cast my memory back there, Lord <br>
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout it <br>
Making love in the green grass <br>
Behind the stadium with you <br>
  <br>
My brown-eyed girl <br>
You, my brown-eyed girl <br>
Do you remember when we used to sing? <br>
  <br>
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da <br>
Just like that  <br>
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da <br>
La tee-da
