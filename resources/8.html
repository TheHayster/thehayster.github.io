<h2>Old Time Rock & Roll</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Just take those old records off the shelf <br>
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself <br>
Today's music ain't got the same soul <br>
I like that old time rock 'n' roll <br>
Don't try to take me to a disco <br>
You'll never even get me out on the floor <br>
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door <br>
I like that old time rock 'n' roll <br>
     <br>
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll <br>
That kind of music just soothes the soul <br>
I reminisce about the days of old <br>
With that old time rock 'n' roll (oh) <br>
     <br>
Won't go to hear 'em play a tango <br>
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul <br>
There's only one sure way to get me to go <br>
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll <br>
Call me a relic, call me what you will <br>
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill <br>
Today's music ain't got the same soul <br>
I like that old time rock 'n' roll <br>
     <br>
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll <br>
That kind of music just soothes the soul <br>
I reminisce about the days of old <br>
With that old time rock 'n' roll  <br>
     <br>
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll <br>
That kind of music just soothes the soul <br>
I reminisce about the days of old <br>
With that old time rock 'n' roll  <br>     
    <br>
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll <br>
That kind of music just soothes the soul <br>
I reminisce about the days of old <br>
With that old time rock 'n' roll  <br>
