<h2>Margaritaville</h2>
<font size="+2"><p>
Livin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake <br>
All of those tourists covered with oil <br>
Strummin' my six-string on my front porch swing <br>
Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil <br>
 <br>
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville <br>
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt <br>
(Salt! Salt! Salt!) <br>
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame <br>
But I know it's nobody's fault <br>
 <br>
Don't know the reason I stayed here all season <br>
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo <br>
But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie <br>
How it got here I haven't a clue <br>
 <br>
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville <br>
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt <br>
(Salt! Salt! Salt!) <br>
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame <br>
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault <br>
 <br>
I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop tart <br>
Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home <br>
But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render <br>
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on <br>
  <br>
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville <br>
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt <br>
(Salt! Salt! Salt!) <br>
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame <br>
But I know it's my own damn fault <br>
 <br>
Yes, and some people claim that there's a woman to blame <br>
And I know it's my own damn fault <br>
